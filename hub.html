    <h2>Welcome to the poorly styled Hub World of</h2><br><h1>Camilo's Test Website!</h1><br>
    Here, you can go to any of the three things I've been working on in my website. It's obviously not perfect,
    but it's just for fun, really. Here you go!
    <ol>
      <li><a href="/Blue Ball/index.html">The mesmerizing gif you can't look away from (now with music!)</a></li>
      <li><a href="/Text Reverser/index.html">Want to reverse a sentence? Use my home-made text reverser!</a></li>
      <li><a href="/Tutorial/howto.html">Here's a tutorial on how to create this.</a></li>
    </ol><br>
    <!--By pressing 1, 2, or 3 on your keyboard, you can go to the respective link.<br>
    Once you're at one of the links, you can go back to the hub by pressing Escape.-->
